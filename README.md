# Lorenzo Andreoli

I'm a software developer passionate about solving real-world problems through code. I started my journey in tech driven by curiosity and a strong desire to understand how things work behind the scenes. Currently pursuing a degree in **Analysis and Systems Development**, I've been building up my skills both academically and independently. I began programming with **Java**, focusing on logic and fundamentals, and since then I've expanded into fullstack development with **PHP**, **MySQL**, and **JavaScript**, following the **MVC architecture**. 

Iâ€™ve worked as a **freelancer**, helping a startup develop a clinic management system, and I also created automations using **Python** to improve internal processes in the legal and HR sectors of a public organization â€” including a **rÃ©sumÃ© analyzer with AI (Groq API)** and a **PDF renaming tool**.

My current focus is on mastering **Spring Boot**, **Docker**, and **AWS**, aiming to become a well-rounded backend developer with cloud skills.
