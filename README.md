# Lorenzo Andreoli

I am a software developer passionate about solving real-world problems through programming. I began my journey in technology driven by curiosity and a strong desire to understand how things work behind the scenes. I am currently pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development, continuously improving my skills both academically and through self-study. 
I started learning Java, focusing on programming logic and core fundamentals. Since then, I have been applying concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), MVC architecture, and using tools such as Spring Boot and Maven to build robust applications. I have experience with relational databases (MySQL) and non-relational databases (MongoDB, DynamoDB), as well as knowledge of RESTful APIs, Git, GitHub, Docker, and microservices principles. I am also familiar with AWS services such as S3 and DynamoDB. 
I worked as a freelancer, assisting a startup in developing a management system for clinics, and also created Python automations to optimize internal processes in the legal and HR departments of a public organization â€” including a rÃ©sumÃ© analyzer powered by AI (Groq API) and a PDF renaming tool.
